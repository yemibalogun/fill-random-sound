# SETTING UP PREMIERE PRO PANEL

### 1.	Extract the SoundFiller folder.
### 2.	Enable loading of unsigned panels. 
On MacOS, type the following into Terminal, then relaunch Finder (either via rebooting, or from the Force Quit dialog):

defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.11.plist PlayerDebugMode 1


On Windows, make the following registry entry (a new Key, of type String):

### 3. Put panel into extensions directory
Put extracted SoundFiller folder here, to have Premiere Pro load it:
#### Windows:    
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions

#### Mac:        
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions
Note: That's the root /Library, not a specific user's ~/Library...


Open Adobe Premiere Pro application, click Window and navigate to Extensions. Your panel should now be loaded there.

# ExtendScript Documentation: Audio Insertion and Bin Management Script for Adobe Premiere Pro

This ExtendScript is designed to enhance the functionality of Adobe Premiere Pro, allowing users to automatically insert audio clips from a specified bin into an active sequence with defined in and out points. The script includes various utility functions for handling bin and audio clip operations, in addition to project-saving capabilities and improved error handling.

### 1. Overview

This script provides automation features that allow users to:
- Insert audio clips into a specific audio track between marked in/out points in the timeline.
- Handle errors related to missing bins, invalid in/out points, and missing audio tracks.
- Retrieve and manage bin structures for easier clip insertion.
- Randomly space and insert audio clips into the timeline to avoid collisions.

---

### 2. Utility Functions

#### `serialize(obj)`
- **Purpose**: Converts objects into string representations.
- **Parameters**:
  - `obj`: The object to be serialized.
- **Returns**: A string representation of the object.

#### `saveProject()`
- **Purpose**: Saves the current Premiere Pro project.
- **Returns**: None.

---

### 3. Main Functions

#### `insertAudioFromBinToMarkedPoints(trackNumber, selectedBinPath)`
- **Purpose**: Automatically insert audio clips from a selected bin into a specified audio track within marked in and out points in the timeline.
- **Parameters**:
  - `trackNumber`: The audio track number where clips will be inserted.
  - `selectedBinPath`: The bin path (string) from which to retrieve the audio clips.
- **Returns**: 
  - An object with `success` and `message` properties indicating the status of the operation.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Validate the `trackNumber` and `selectedBinPath` inputs.
  2. Retrieve the active sequence and the specified audio track.
  3. Get the in and out points from the timeline and validate them.
  4. Locate the specified bin using `findBinByPath`.
  5. Extract audio clips from the bin using `getAudioClipsFromBin`.
  6. Insert the clips with random spacing using `insertClipsRandomlyWithSpacing`.
  7. Handle errors and return a status object with detailed messages.

#### `getAudioClipsFromBin(bin)`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all audio clips with `.mp3` or `.wav` extensions from a specified bin.
- **Parameters**:
  - `bin`: The bin object containing media files.
- **Returns**: An array of audio clip objects found in the bin.
  
- **Note**: The function uses regular expressions to identify audio files by extension.

#### `findBinByPath(rootItem, binPath)`
- **Purpose**: Locates a bin in the project using a specified path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `rootItem`: The root item of the project.
  - `binPath`: A string representing the bin path (e.g., `"Audio/SFX"`).
- **Returns**: The bin object if found, or `null` if the bin could not be located.

- **Steps**:
  1. Split the `binPath` by `/` to break down folder levels.
  2. Traverse the project's bin hierarchy, looking for matching bin names at each level.
  3. Return the bin object if all levels are found.

#### `insertClipsRandomlyWithSpacing(clips, track, inPoint, outPoint)`
- **Purpose**: Inserts audio clips into the specified track, distributed evenly between in and out points.
- **Parameters**:
  - `clips`: Array of audio clips to insert.
  - `track`: The audio track object where the clips will be inserted.
  - `inPoint`: The timeline's in-point where insertion should begin.
  - `outPoint`: The timeline's out-point where insertion should end.
- **Returns**: The number of clips successfully inserted.

- **Steps**:
  1. Shuffle the array of clips to randomize their order.
  2. Calculate even spacing between clips based on the total duration.
  3. Insert clips sequentially into the track at calculated positions.
  4. Handle errors in insertion (e.g., if thereâ€™s not enough space).

---

### 4. Error Handling

The script includes multiple checks and validations:
- **Track and Bin Validation**: Ensures the specified audio track and bin path are valid.
- **In/Out Point Validation**: Ensures valid in and out points are selected in the timeline.
- **Empty Bin Handling**: Warns if no audio clips are found in the selected bin.
- **Clip Insertion Errors**: Logs an error message if a clip cannot be inserted due to timing or spacing issues.

---

### 5. Event Logging

The script uses two logging mechanisms:
1. **ExtendScript Console**: Outputs messages to the ExtendScript console using `$.writeln()`.
2. **Event Panel Updates**: Optionally updates the Premiere Pro Event Panel using `app.setSDKEventMessage()` (if supported).

All messages, including success and error notifications, are logged.

---

### 6. Usage Example

To use this script in Premiere Pro:
1. Ensure you have a valid audio bin path and an active sequence with in/out points marked.
2. Call the `insertAudioFromBinToMarkedPoints()` function, passing the target track number and bin path.

```javascript
$.runScript.insertAudioFromBinToMarkedPoints(1, "Audio/Voiceovers");
```

This example inserts audio clips from the "Audio/Voiceovers" bin into the first audio track of the active sequence, evenly spaced between the marked in and out points.

By utilizing this ExtendScript, users can significantly streamline the process of inserting audio clips and managing bins in Adobe Premiere Pro, improving both efficiency and organization.
